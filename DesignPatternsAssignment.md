Design Patterns Assignment
===================
Create a branch on git and name it as your roll and work on it. Once you are done, push the code to github. 
Do not merge with master branch. I have added one such example under the name Shakil Ahmed, 
you will follow this style of writing but you need to add programming code as well.

## Null Object Design Pattern

### Objective

Utility classes often provide different methods of doing the same task. Depending on the implementation, these classes may have the no operation(**NOP**) property. What is meant by NOP here is that, there may be some default behavior that is expected when there is no implementation of these object found. When there is nothing, there is **Null**.

### Motivation

Often we need to code a *Serializer* for our data structure which will be saved in the disk, or transmitted over the network. Lets assume we have a data structure named *FileInfo* which will be serialized. A *Serializer* is consists of two primary method, *serialize* and *unserialize*.

As long as these two method can work with each other, we do not care how they are implemented. So, there can be multiple implementation.

Lets think, we haven't decided yet, how we will implement the *Serializer*( There can be multiple serializer, one for network transmission, one for saving on the disk etc). How can we work with other codes which uses *serializer*?

### Solution

One way is to pass a Null reference as a serializer to the *FileInfo* structure. Then inside the *FileInfo* will check whether there is an *Serializer* exist or not. If the reference is Null, it will return an default serialization, otherwise passes the responsibility to the *Serializer*.

Pretty easy, right? But we are letting the *FileInfo* to decide how to *serialize* itself. Which breaks the single responsibility principle.

The solution that we will discuss here, is to use a Default implementation of a *Serializer* class. Which is known as *Null Object* Design pattern.

## Visitor Design Pattern

### Refreshing Your Mindset

The pattern name *Visitor* is often misleading. People may think *Visitor Design Pattern* has something to do with visitation or iteration[1]. But it is not. From Design Patterns,

> Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

So, Before you read the rest of the article, I strongly recommend you to reset your mind if your had similar assertion that *Visitor* has something to do with visitation. Understanding the pattern will be easier with it.

### Motivation

Let's you have a hierarchy of *Vehicle*s. You have 3 sub-classes of *Vehicle*s Boat, Car and Copter. Now all of their usual functions are defined. For simplicity, lets assume their implementation is very complex(Yes, complexity can simplify things, we will see later).

Now You are going to add a method *repaint* for all the sub-classes of *Vehicle*s. As the classes are complex we are not going to modify each sub-class
every time we need to add an operation on them, right?

But What can we do? If you are programming in a language that support *dynamic method dispatch*, then, *visitor* pattern comes to a rescue.

### The Implementation

  We need a template for visitor operation. All the method will be a subclass of this.

    class Operation
    {
    public:
        virtual void youGotABoat(Boat *b) = 0;
        virtual void youGotACar(Car *c) = 0;
        virtual void youGotACopter(Copter *c) = 0;
    };


The similar classes are decedent from a super-class which defines all the similar properties and methods.

    class Vehicle
    {
        /* codes for all the complex operation we assumed
        //~~~
        //~~~
        */

    public:
        //now, lets make the vehicle visitor friendly
        virtual void perform(Operation *v) = 0;
    };

Concrete implementation of sub-classes.

    //define Boat
    class Boat: public Vehicle
    {
        /* codes for all the complex operation we assumed
        //~~~
        //~~~
        */

    public:
        //now, lets perform the task
        void perform(Operation *v){
            v->youGotABoat(this);
        }
    };

    //define Car
    class Car: public Vehicle
    {
        /* codes for all the complex operation we assumed
        //~~~
        //~~~
        */

    public:
        //now, lets perform the task
        void perform(Operation *v){
            v->youGotACar(this);
        }
    };

    //define copter
    class Copter: public Vehicle
    {
        /* codes for all the complex operation we assumed
        //~~~
        //~~~
        */

    public:
        //now, lets perform the task
        void perform(Operation *v){
            v->youGotACopter(this);
        }
    };

The hierarchy is ready to accept any method that is similar to all the vehicles.

    //Lets add the method Run which will define the running method
    class Run: public Operation
    {
    public:
        void youGotABoat(Boat *b){
            cout << "A boat is running on water." << endl;
        }
        void youGotACar(Car *c){
            cout << "A car is running on road." << endl;
        }
        void youGotACopter(Copter *c){
            cout << "You do not have enough money to run a copter" << endl;
        }
    };

We can add others similarly. I strongly recommend readers to implement a method repaint, without modifying any existing classes which will repaint a Vehicle.

    int main()
    {
        Boat boat;
        Copter copter;
        Run run;

        boat.perform(&run);
        copter.perform(&run);

        return 0;
    }

### Refresh Your Mind, Revisited

Did you answer my question in the motivation part? Oh, you forgot. Lets see again:
> Now You are going to add a method *repaint* for all the sub-classes of *Vehicle*s. As the classes are complex we are not going to modify each sub-class
every time we need to add an operation on them, right?

Maybe you agreed with me. Said it aloud, **RIGHT**. But that's not true. The idea of complexity was to keep you free from unnecessary thinking of when we are going to use *Visitor* pattern.

Stackoverflow has a very nice answer:

> Let's think of a simple class hierarchy. I have classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and methods A, B, C and D. Lay them out like in a spreadsheet: the classes are lines and the methods are columns.

> Now, Object Oriented design presumes you are more likely to grow new classes than new methods, so adding more lines, so to speak, is easier. You just add a new class, specify what's different in that class, and inherits the rest.

> Sometimes, though, the classes are relatively static, but you need to add more methods frequently -- adding columns. The standard way in an OO design would be to add such methods to all classes, which can be costly. The Visitor pattern makes this easy.
