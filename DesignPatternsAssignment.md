Design Patterns Assignment
===================
Create a branch on git and name it as your roll and work on it. Once you are done, push the code to github. 
Do not merge with master branch. I have added one such example under the name Shakil Ahmed, 
you will follow this style of writing but you need to add programming code as well.

## Visitor Design Pattern

### Refreshing Your Mindset

The pattern name *Visitor* is often misleading. People may think *Visitor Design Pattern* has something to do with visitation or iteration. But it is not. From Design Patterns,

> Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

So, Before you read the rest of the article, I strongly recommend you to reset your mind if your had similar assertion that *Visitor* has something to do with visitation. Understanding the pattern will be easier with it.

### Motivation

Let's you have a hierarchy of *Vehicle*s. You have 3 sub-classes of *Vehicle*s Boat, Car and Copter. Now all of their usual functions are defined. For simplicity, lets assume their implementation is very complex(Yes, complexity can simplify things, we will see later).

Now You are going to add a method *repaint* for all the sub-classes of *Vehicle*s. As the classes are complex we are not going to modify each sub-class
every time we need to add an operation on them, right?

But What can we do? If you are programming in a language that support *dynamic method dispatch*, then, *visitor* pattern comes to a rescue.

### The Implementation

### Application: Double Dispatch

 - Thread pool 
 - Thread-specific storage 
 - Twin
